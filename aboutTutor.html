      <img src="./images/tutorJustin.png" alt="Justin Ernest"> <p>Hey there! My name is Justin Ernest, and I'm a passionate tutor with a knack for explaining complex topics in a clear and engaging way. Currently, I'm a sophomore (second-year student) at the University of the Witwatersrand, tackling a challenging but rewarding B.Sc. in Computer Science. But my love for learning goes way back. In 2020, I graduated matric with a whopping five distinctions, including Math, Physical Science, Life Science, Geography, and Life Orientation. Those late nights studying definitely paid off, and I want to help you achieve the same academic success!</p>

      <h3>Why Tutoring Matters to Me</h3>
      <p>Education is more than just grades; it's about unlocking your potential and giving yourself the tools to succeed in life. I believe everyone deserves the chance to shine, and tutoring allows me to pay forward the help I received when I was in high school. Seeing the "light bulb moment" when a student grasps a challenging concept is incredibly rewarding.</p>

      <h3>Beyond the Books</h3>
      <p>While I'm passionate about academics (and yes, that includes coding this website!), I also enjoy exploring the outdoors, playing video games, and keeping up with the latest tech trends. I find that fostering a positive and open learning environment allows for deeper understanding and a more enjoyable learning experience.</p>
